## Covid-19-Data-Analysis

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to understand testing rates, positive case rates, and visualize trends over time. The analysis employs data wrangling techniques and creates heatmaps to effectively present the findings.

## Tools and Technologies

R

RStudio

dplyr

tidyr

ggplot2

reshape2

readr

tibble

Dataset

The dataset contains comprehensive information on COVID-19 cases, tests, and hospitalizations across different countries. It includes essential columns such as the country or region, date of reporting, total tests conducted, and total confirmed cases.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required packages installed in R to run the analysis.

## Steps to Run the Analysis

Load the necessary libraries at the beginning of your script.

Load the COVID-19 dataset into R.

Prepare the data by filtering and cleaning, ensuring that necessary columns are selected and handling any missing values.

Aggregate the data by country and date to analyze total tests and positive cases.

Visualize the data through line plots and heatmaps to compare trends across selected countries.

Interpret the results to understand the observed trends in COVID-19 data.

## Expected Outcomes
Upon completing this project:

I Gained valuable skills in data manipulation and visualization using R.

I Develop a deeper understanding of COVID-19 testing and case trends.

I Create actionable insights from real-world health data.
